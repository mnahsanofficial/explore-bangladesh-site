                        village life of Bangladesh, where around 80% population of the country lives. As per your
                        interest, we shall send you to the specific village. It will be around 6-7 hours drive from
                        Dhaka. On this trip, you will experience the slow and easy pace of rural life that has not
                        remarkably changed its form over the decades, except for the inclusion of the modern technology
                        in some sphere of life. While in a village, you can either observe their life style or you can
                        participate in some of their daily activities. Accommodation will be arranged in your home stay
                        family, which will be very simple but clean and cordial.&nbsp;</span><br><span

                        life, you will find a true richness of heart. Steaming hot rice with fish and vegetable curry is
                        really delicious. Villages are abundant with papaya &amp; coconut in the trees, and streets are
                        busy with cows, goats, chickens, ducks, and water buffaloes. So, what are you going to encounter
                        with? Something you'll never be able to experience in your home country is surely there. After
