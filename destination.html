                    Dhaka, when it became a great Mughal trading port and finally the capital of Bengal in 1608. Islam

                <p style="color: #000000;">Ahsan Manzil: Ahsan Manzil is one of the most significant architectural
                    monuments of Bangladesh. It was built in 1872 in the style of Indo-Saracen Revival architecture on

                <p style="color: #000000;">Bara Katra: Dhaka, an architectural relic is situated to the south of Chawk
                    Bazar close to the bank of the river Buriganga. Originally, the Katra enclosed a quadrangular
                    courtyard with 22 rooms on all of its four sides. Two gateways were erected, one each on the north
                    and south. The ruins consist of an edifice having a river frontage. The southern wing of the
                    structure was planned on a grand scale and was marked with an elaborate three-storied gate
                    containing an octagonal central chamber. The remaining portion was two-storied and encased by
                    projected octagonal towers. The gateway structure is rectangular in plan. It is lofty in height and
                    its fronton is projected towards the river. A tall alcove rising to the second storey reduces the
                    mass of this projection. The wall surface is relieved with panels that are square as well as
                    rectangular and that contain a variety of decorations of four-centered, cusped, horseshoe and flat
                    arches. Above the apex of the alcove open the windows of the third storey. Under the alcove is the
                    main arched entrance which leads to the guardroom. Furthermore, as one passes through two successive
                    archways, one comes across an octagonal domed hall, the ceiling of which is plastered and bears
                    various net-patterns and foliaged designs. The double storied structure resolves on both sides of
                    the central entrance into a row of five vaulted rooms in the ground floor and living rooms with a
                    continuous corridor on the upper one. Likewise, the upper floors of the entrance are furnished with
                    rooms. The three storyed corner towers are hollow and can be approached from the subsidiary
                    structures. Following the traditional pattern of the caravan-sarai of Central Asia, the Bara Katra
                    was highly fortified and was embellished with all the features of the imperial Mughal style contains
                    two inscriptions in Persian, one records that it was built in 1053 AH (1643-44 AD) and the other
                    contains the date 1055 AH (1645-46 AD) and confirms that SHAH SHUJA gave the building to Mir Abul
                    Qasim to be used as a Katra on the condition that the officials in charge of the endowments (waqf)
                    should not take any rent from any deserving person alighting therein. It should be noted here that
                    more than half of the Katra building has already been destroyed and the building as a whole is in a
                    dilapidated condition. It could not be taken over by the Department of Archaeology owing to the
                    resistance of its owners. The owners have made several alterations to the original character of the
                    building and have also started construction of a new multi-storied building in the area.
                    Nevertheless, the surviving ruins stand as one of the most important monuments of Bengal. It is
                    perhaps the most magnificent Mughal edifice of Bangladesh which has a monumental central archway.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #000000;">Chhota Katra: Dhaka,it is situated about around 183 meter east of the bara
                    katra at hakim habibur rahman lane on the bank of the river Buriganga in Mughal (old) Dhaka, built
                    by Shaista Khan in about 1664 AD. It is also said that the Katra was constructed to accommodate some
                    officials and also a part of Shaista Khan’s expanding family. The Katra is rectangular in plan,
                    101.20 m × 92.05m externally and 81.07m 69.19 m internally. The thickness of the outer walls is 0.91
                    to 1.00m and the maximum thickness of the bastion walls is 1.22m. It is similar in plan to that of
                    the Bara Katra, but is smaller in size. There are two gateways, one on the north and the other on
                    the south. The southern one is the main entrance. Both the gateways, though much altered recently,
                    are still in situ. In the two outer corners of the south wall of the structure there are two
                    octagonal towers. The structures around the open courtyard have undergone much renovation,
                    reconstruction and repair. Many modern extensions were also added to the original building. The
                    three storied gateway on the river side has assumed some colonial features. The triple windows and
                    the lofty angle towers reflect the colonial influence during subsequent restoration. It is evident
                    that the structure has lost much of its original look through indiscriminate alterations and
                    unworthy restoration, though they have given it some durability. The two Katras of Dhaka have not
